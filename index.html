    <h2>
      Welcome to the future home of all projects created by Soph (TheMaid)
    </h2>
    <p>
      For now the website is pretty bare, as I am in the process of moving
      coding projects onto github, and production on 'content creation'.
      <br>
      As for what you can expect, small coding projects, video game mods, and video
      passion projects will be coming to the site soon.
      <br> <br>
      As of now most of my finished projects are available on github eventually they will have dedicated spot here on
      this
      website however
